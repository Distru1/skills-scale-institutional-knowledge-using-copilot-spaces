## Best Practices

1. **Document Everything:** Don't rely on verbal communication alone. Use tickets, wiki pages, or shared docs.
2. **Schedule Sync Meetings:** Brief handoff meetings prevent misunderstandings.
3. **Use Templates:** Standardize handoff documentation to ensure nothing is missed.
4. **Confirm Understanding:** Have the receiving role summarize their understanding of the handoff.
5. **Track Dependencies:** Ensure all upstream work is complete before handoff.
6. **Set Clear Expectations:** Define what success looks like for the next phase.
7. **Provide Contact Info:** Make it easy for the receiving role to ask questions.
8. **Review Previous Handoffs:** Learn from past handoffs to improve the process.
